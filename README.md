# microbit-kitronik-car

Using the [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) to control a car buggy. 

The code requires 2 micro:bits that communicate with each other, the [Kitronik motor driver board](https://kitronik.co.uk/collections/microbit-and-accessories/products/5620-motor-driver-board-for-the-bbc-microbit-v2) as well as a car chassis with 2 motor wheels and one ball wheel at the front. 

One micro:bit is placed in the motor driver board and the other is used as a remote. 

The remote reacts to the left, right, up, down and button 'a' pressed gestures but that can be modified.
